"""Adapter for SWE-bench Verified (https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified).

Converts SWE-bench Verified instances into CodeBench :class:`CodeTask` objects
and prepares prediction files for the official SWE-bench evaluation harness.

Leakage policy
--------------
The gold ``patch``, ``test_patch``, ``FAIL_TO_PASS``, and ``PASS_TO_PASS``
fields must NEVER reach a coding agent's prompt. The :class:`CodeTask`
produced here is fully agent-safe: ``test_file`` and ``reference_solution``
hold placeholders, never gold data. Gold data is only available through
:func:`extract_hidden_reference` and is stored under the clearly-marked
``hidden_reference`` key in sample files, for sanity checks — not inference.
