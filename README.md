# CodeBench

> **Benchmarking AI coding agents on real-world repository tasks.**

CodeBench evaluates coding agents on realistic, repo-level Python tasks,
measuring test pass rates, regression rates, tool efficiency, and cost.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

## SWE-bench Verified Tasks

CodeBench can load real-world tasks from
[SWE-bench Verified](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified)
in place of the synthetic samples:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_swebench_sample.py            # sample 5 tasks
python scripts/create_swebench_predictions_template.py
```

See [docs/swebench_experiment.md](docs/swebench_experiment.md) for the full
workflow, including the leakage policy (gold patches are never shown to agents)
and evaluation with the official SWE-bench harness.

## Benchmark Design

Each **CodeTask** is drawn from a real or synthetic repository and includes:
- A natural-language `description`
- A `test_file` with unit tests the agent's code must pass
- A `reference_solution` for comparison
- A `difficulty` rating: EASY / MEDIUM / HARD

Agents submit **generated code** along with metadata (tool calls, latency, cost).
An **ExecutionResult** captures how many tests passed and any regressions introduced.

## Eval Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Pass Rate | tests_passed / tests_total | Primary metric |
| Pass@k | Unbiased estimator (Chen et al. 2021) | k=1,5,10 |
| Regression Rate | regressions / tests_total | Lower is better |
| Tool Efficiency | max(0, 1 − calls/max_calls) | Rewards concise tool use |
| Cost-Adjusted Score | pass_rate / log1p(cost) | Rewards cheap solutions |

## Agent Comparison Table

| Agent | Pass@1 | Pass@5 | Latency (ms) | Cost (USD) |
